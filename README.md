# AI-Based Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic Tool from MRI Images

## Introduction

This project aims to develop an AI-powered tool to assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease from MRI images. The tool will help doctors and medical professionals analyze brain MRI scans more quickly and accurately, leading to earlier and more precise diagnoses of Alzheimer's.

## Project Progress

### Phase 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing (Completed)

- Loaded and explored the "Alzheimer MRI Disease Classification Dataset" from Kaggle.
- Preprocessed the data:
  - Converted images to NumPy arrays.
  - Resized images to 224x224 pixels.
  - Normalized pixel values.

### Phase 2: Model Building and Training (In Progress)

- Researching and selecting suitable deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, ResNet, EfficientNet).
- Implementing transfer learning from pre-trained models.
- Designing and training the model on the preprocessed data.
- Evaluating model performance on the test dataset.

### Phase 3: Deployment and Real-World Evaluation (Not Started)

- Developing a user interface for the tool.
- Deploying and testing the tool in medical facilities.
- Gathering feedback and evaluating the tool's real-world effectiveness.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python
